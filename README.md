## Description

The Aliens EA is an advanced price action forex software designed to identify market movements and initiate trades based on pullback patterns. It uses the MetaTrader 5 platform and is programmed in MQL5. This EA aims to take advantage of potential market reversals by entering trades in the direction of the identified movement.

## Features

- Magic Number: A unique identifier for the trades initiated by the EA.
- Lot Size: The size of each trade.
- Stop Loss: The stop loss level for the trades.
- Take Profit: The take profit level for the trades.
- Max Pull Back Bars: The maximum number of pullback bars used to identify market movements.

## How it Works

The Aliens EA works by monitoring the bid and ask prices of the symbol in real-time. It identifies if the market is moving in one direction or experiencing a pullback. If the market is moving in one direction, the EA keeps track of the number of pullback bars.

Once the pullback count exceeds the specified maximum pullback bars, the EA initiates a trade in the identified direction. It calculates the entry price, stop loss price, and take profit price based on the current market conditions and the input parameters.

If the market is moving upwards, the EA executes a buy trade. If the market is moving downwards, the EA executes a sell trade. It uses the OrderSend function to send the trade request to the broker.

The EA also includes error handling to check if the trade was executed successfully. If there is an error, the error code is printed to the terminal.
